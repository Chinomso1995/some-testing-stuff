Change-return.js is for task 1

Change-gatsby-function.js is for task 2


Install all node modules and run the command npx babel src -d build to compile all available code in the src directory.

Theres already some examples. 



Note since the babel plugins are for the React hook useGet, you might need to comment one of them out in the babel config and gatsby node to see how they each work
